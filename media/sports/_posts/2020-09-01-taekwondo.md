                Taekwondo is the oldest Korean martial art and is still included in the Korean military training today. Taekwondo competitions involve poomsae, a set of defined pattern defence and attack techniques, and kyorugi, which involves sparring with an opponent. TP Taekwondo Team competes in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) Taekwondo Games and external competitions annually.<br>
