                    The Global Connect Student Group (GCSG) harnesses interests in the following topics:<br>
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)</li>
                        <li>Diversity and Inclusiveness</li>
                        <li>Cultural expressions</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    As taught in TP-Fundamental Global Studies classes, these topics have seen increased attention by the global and local communities, which also include corporations and citizenry, as we approach a paradigm shift in the 21st century.<br>

                    Participating students can expect to be involved in the following:<br>
                </p>

                        <li>National Integration Council's award-winning D.I.Y (Diversity. Inclusion. You.) programmes</li>
